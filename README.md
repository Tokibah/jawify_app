# Jawify

Jawify is a modern, interactive learning app designed to make learning Jawi exciting and accessible for teenagers. Inspired by the style of Duolingo, Jawify combines gamified lessons, bite-sized quizzes, and daily practice goals â€” but with a unique focus on mastering the Jawi script.

With a calming yet fun design, Jawify keeps young learners engaged without overwhelming them. Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, Jawify turns traditional Jawi learning into an enjoyable digital journey.
